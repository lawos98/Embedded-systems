# Conclusion and Future Improvements

The current design of the system serves the intended purpose of generating a visual representation of the audio input based on detected audio features such as peaks, onsets, and bass drops. It also allows for customization through a web interface where users can fine-tune the thresholds for detection and adjust the color palette. Despite these strengths, there are areas where the system could benefit from improvements and potential features that could be added.

### Issues

#### Hardware Limitations:

* It is impossible to analyze sound with more sophisticated algorithms like with Fourier transform , as well as to use more complex filters 
* Depending on the hardware used to implement the system, there may be limitations in processing speed, which can impact real-time audio visualizing. This is particularly true when dealing with high-frequency audio or large amounts of data.
* The bulbs that were used in this project have a limited number of requests they can receive per minute. This makes it impossible to transmit the current color in real time. Once the limitation is exceeded, controlling the bulb becomes impossible ( The number of requests per minute that does not cause an overrun is 10 )

#### Threshold Tuning:

Currently, the thresholds for peaks, onsets, and bass drops are manually set by the user. Automated, adaptive thresholding could be developed to adjust to changing audio input dynamically.

#### Security Considerations:

With any networked system, there's a need to consider potential security vulnerabilities. It's essential to ensure that the system cannot be easily hacked, and that sensitive user data is protected.

#### Color Variation:

The predefined colors can lack variation if not manually adjusted, leading to potentially repetitive or monotonous visual output.

### Future Improvements and Ideas:

#### User Interface Improvements:

The web interface could be expanded to provide more detailed real-time feedback about the system's performance and state. This could include visualizations of audio levels, detection events, or cursor positions.


#### More Visual Effects:

The system can be extended with more Visualizer themes to make the use even more varied

#### Advanced Audio Feature Detection:
More advanced audio feature detection could be implemented to distinguish different instruments, vocals, or even specific notes. This could be used to create visualizations that respond to specific elements of the music.
