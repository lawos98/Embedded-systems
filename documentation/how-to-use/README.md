# How to use 

The audio visualizer system is designed to be as user-friendly as possible, enabling a "plug-and-play" experience. Here's a quick guide on how to get started:

1. **Power up the system**: Connect your system to a power source. Ensure all necessary hardware is properly connected.

2. **Wait for system initialization**: Upon startup, the system will initiate a sequence to establish connections with all the visualizer devices. During this initialization process, each of the visualizer devices should blink, signaling that they are connected and ready to function.

3. **Verify device connection**: If all the devices blink correctly, this indicates that they are properly connected, and the system is ready to visualize audio. If any device does not blink, check its connections and ensure it's functioning properly.

4. **Play audio**: Now you can start playing audio from your chosen source. The visualizer should react to the audio input, creating a dynamic, color-based visualization of the sound.

5. **Fine-tune parameters**: If you wish to customize the visualization, navigate to the system's web interface using the provided URL. Here you can modify detection thresholds, predefined colors, and device coordinates. Additionally, you can view the current color vector generated by the system.

## Modifying System Properties

The web page ( on the arduino board Ip ) interface allows users to modify various thresholds associated with audio detection and cursor behavior. These include:

* `Bass Drop Threshold`: The level above which a sound is considered a bass drop.
* `Peak Threshold`: The level above which a sound is considered a peak.
* `Onset Threshold`: The level above which a sound is considered an onset.
* `Silence Threshold`: The level below which a sound is considered silence.
* `Predefined Colors`: The colors used in the color vector, which can be altered to customize the visual output.
* `Device Coordinates`: The position and size of the region associated with each device.

These parameters are presented to the user in a form. After making the desired adjustments, the user can submit the form to update the system settings.

## Visualizing the Current Color Vector

In addition to system modification, the web interface also allows for a visual representation of the current color vector state. For each element in the color vector, a corresponding color square is displayed on the webpage.

These color squares give a real-time glimpse of what the audio visualizer is currently displaying. The users can observe these color changes and adjust the system properties accordingly for a more customized experience.

In conclusion, this web configuration capability not only allows for greater control and customization of the system but also provides a convenient and intuitive way to monitor the system's output.
